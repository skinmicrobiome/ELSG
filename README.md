# ELSG - Early-Life Skin Genome Catalog
The Early-Life Skin Genomes (ELSG) catalog comprises 9,483 prokaryotic genomes from 1,056 species, 206 fungal genomes from 13 species, and 39 eukaryotic viral sequences. This genome catalog substantially expands the diversity of species previously known to comprise human skin microbiome and improves the classification rate of sequenced data by 21%. This GitHub repository contains codes utilized in the ELSG study and organized in the form of Snakemake pipelines.

The raw shotgun metagenomic sequencing data are available in the NCBI BioProject database under project number [PRJNA971252](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA971252). 

The MAGs within the ELSG catalog can be found at https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/projects/ELSG/, where users have access to download nonredundant genomes, species-level representative genomes, phylogenetic tree files, protein catalog, pan-genome annotations, and a custom Kraken 2 database.
